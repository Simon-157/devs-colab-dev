Here are some additional ideas to make your project more efficient and viable:

Implement an authentication system using OAuth, so users can log in using their Google, Facebook, or other social media accounts.

Use a real-time database like Firebase, so changes made by one user in a room will be instantly visible to other users in the same room.

Implement a version control system like Git, so users can easily view and revert to previous versions of their code.

Add a feature to automatically grade the code submitted by users and provide feedback on areas for improvement.

Implement a feature to allow users to chat with each other while working on the problem together.

Allow users to save their code snippets to their own personal library for future reference.
